Introduction 2
As 2
Java 6
developers, 1
we 2
often 3
find 1
ourselves 1
bogged 1
down 1
by 5
boilerplate 4
code. 1
Accessor 1
methods, 2
mutator 1
constructors, 1
equals(), 2
hashCode(), 2
and 21
toString() 3
are 4
essential 1
but 1
take 1

Spring 4
Framework, 1
widely 1
used 1
for 6
building 1
enterprise 1
applications, 1
is 11
fan 1
reducing 2
boilerplate. 1
However, 2
even 2
with 7
Spring, 1
certain 1
amount 1
it 4
unavoidable?”unless 1
introduce 1
Project 5
Lombok 16
into 6
equation. 1
provides 1
annotations 4
that 5
can 4
drastically 1
minimize 1
code, 2
improving 1
readability 1
maintainability. 1
Among 1
these 2
annotations, 3
@FieldDefaults 2
@Data 2
commonly 1
used, 1

developers 2
have 3
write. 1
While 1
powerful 1
versatile 1
language, 1
it?™s 1
criticized 1
its 3
verbosity, 1
especially 1
when 3
compared 1
more 2
modern 1
languages 1
like 3
Kotlin 1
or 1

Java?™s 1
verbosity 2
isn?™t 1

directly 1

Writing 1
time-consuming 1
increases 1
likelihood 1
errors. 1
Imagine 1
class 3
numerous 1

each 2
requiring 1
own 1
getter 2
setter 2
method. 2
situation 1
quickly 1
turns 1

nightmare, 1
particularly 1
you 6
start 1
adding 1
methods 3
equals() 2
hashCode() 2

should 1
be 3

How 1
Works 2
utilizing 1
annotation 1
processing 1
tool 1
available 1
Compiler. 1
your 9
compiled, 1
scans 1
annotations. 1
Upon 1
finding 1
them, 1
corresponding 1
gets 1
incorporated 1

files. 1
Essentially, 1
Compiler 1
sees 1
version 3

though 1
didn't 1
actually 1
it. 1

both 2
benefits 1
drawbacks. 1
On 4
upside, 1
don?™t 1
worry 1
about 1
runtime 1
overhead 1
reflection-based 1
approaches. 1
downside, 1
generated 1
not 1
visible 1
source 1
